Feature Specification Sheet (Final Version)
Summary of Improvements
This document outlines the features of an interactive event catalog. The core application provides a stable, minimalist interface for browsing a catalog and selecting items for an event. Key upgrades include a consolidated header for all event details, centralized state management, and a vertically scrolling, responsive catalog.

A new **Beta Toolkit**, accessible via a subtle trigger, allows users to enable advanced features for collaboration and planning.

AI Collaboration Guidelines
Core Principles
(Guidelines remain the same)

Core Functionality (MVP)
Airtable Integration: The application's data is powered by an Airtable database.
Secure API Proxy: The spec requires a serverless function to secure the API token, but this is currently incomplete.
Session Management: User selections can be saved, generating a unique, shareable URL. A dropdown menu displays saved sessions, and selecting one loads the session.
Dynamic Catalog Display:

- **Standard Vertical Layout**: Events are displayed in a responsive grid that scrolls vertically with the main page. More items are loaded as the user scrolls.
- **Event Cards**: Each event is presented on a "card" that shows its name, image, and price.
- **Simple Favoriting**: Users can select an event by clicking a heart icon, which adds it to the "Your Selections" carousel. Selected items have a simple "Remove" button.

Dynamic Header: A sticky header contains all primary event details and controls: Event Name, Date, Headcount, Event Goals, Collaborators, Total Cost, and the Save & Share button. The header collapses to a single summary line on scroll.

Filtering and Sorting
Multi-Faceted Filtering: Users can refine the catalog view using filters for search, price, duration, status, **category, and subcategory**.
Unified Sorting: A "Sort by" dropdown controls the order of the main catalog, favorites, and locked-in items simultaneously.
Options include sorting by price and name.

Beta Toolkit
A subtle "beta" subscript next to the main title can be clicked to reveal a toolkit with advanced, toggleable features.

- **Collab Mode:**
    - Enables an emoji reaction bar on all cards, allowing users to vote on items.
    - Adds a "Sort by Reactions" option to the sorting dropdown.

- **Event Planner Mode:**
    - Replaces the simple "Remove" button on selected items with a fun, multi-state sequence for tracking an item's status.
    - **Promote:** An unlocked item shows a heart (`üíò`) that changes to an engagement ring (`üíç`) on hover. Clicking it "locks" the item.
    - **Locked State:** A locked item is represented by a ball and chain (`‚õìÔ∏è`).
    - **Demote:** A locked item shows a hammer (`üî®`) to "break" the lock.
    - **Remove:** An unlocked item shows a broken heart (`üíî`) to remove it.

- **History Mode:**
    - Enables Undo (`‚Ü©Ô∏è`) and Redo (`‚Ü™Ô∏è`) buttons in the header, allowing users to step backward and forward through their changes.
