# Feature Specification Sheet (Final Version)

## Summary of Improvements
This document outlines the features of an interactive event catalog. The core application provides a dynamic, hierarchical interface for browsing a catalog and building an event plan. Key features include a consolidated header for event details, a vertically scrolling catalog of "Interactive Cards," and a new Beta Toolkit for advanced features.

## Core Functionality (MVP)

### Airtable Integration
The application's data is powered by an Airtable database. A serverless function is specified for securing the API token, but this is currently deferred.

### Session Management
User selections can be saved, generating a unique, shareable URL. A dropdown menu in the header will display saved sessions, allowing a user to load a previous plan.

### Hierarchical Catalog Display
The catalog is organized as a hierarchy of interactive items. Items can be either **Groupings** (e.g., "Activities," which contain other items) or final **Bookable Items** (e.g., "Escape Room," which can be configured and added to an event). This structure allows users to navigate from broad categories to specific details.

### The Interactive Card
Every item in the catalog is presented on a versatile "Interactive Card." The card's appearance and functionality adapt based on the item it represents. All cards feature a **Heart (‚ù§Ô∏è) icon** for universal selection, allowing a user to add any item or grouping to their plan at any level of detail.

### Card Interaction Model
Users can explore the catalog in two main ways:
* **Focused Exploration:** Users navigate the hierarchy within a single card. A Grouping card has an **Options Control (‚öôÔ∏è)** that transforms the card to display a selected child item, and a **Parent Button (‚¨ÜÔ∏è)** to navigate back up the hierarchy.
* **Broad Exploration:** A Grouping card features an **Explode (üí•) button**, which replaces the single card with a grid of new cards for each of its child options. A corresponding **Implode ( ÿßÿ¨ŸÖÿπ) button** collapses this grid back into the single parent card.

### Customizable Bottom Layer
When a card represents a final **Bookable Item**, its **Options Control (‚öôÔ∏è)** switches from navigation to configuration. It displays specific variations (e.g., duration, style) that modify the item's price and details. A field for adding custom notes is also available on these cards.

### Dynamic Header
A sticky header contains all primary event details and controls. A static **Tool Name** ("Event Builder") is positioned in the top-left and includes the trigger for the Beta Toolkit. The main title is a large, editable **Event Name** input field that dictates the browser's page title. Other controls include Date, Headcount, Event Goals, Total Cost, and the Save & Share button.

### Filtering and Sorting
A simple set of controls allows users to refine the catalog view by **Search by name** and **Price**. A "Sort by" dropdown controls the order of the main catalog.

## Beta Toolkit
A subtle "beta" subscript next to the tool name can be clicked to reveal a toolkit with advanced, toggleable features. These features include **Collab Mode**, **Event Planner Mode**, and **History Mode**.
