# Feature Specification Sheet (Final Version)

## Summary of Improvements
This document outlines the features of an interactive event catalog that has undergone significant architectural and functional improvements.

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### Core Principles
This section outlines the rules and best practices for our collaborative development process to ensure efficiency, clarity, and consistency.

#### For the AI (My Responsibilities)
1.  **Maintain Functionality:** I will ensure that any code modifications do not break existing, working features.
2.  **Standard Code Blocks:** I will provide all code in standard text blocks (no special UI) for easy copying and pasting.
3.  **Provide Complete Files:** I will always provide the entire content of any modified file to ensure simple and accurate updates.
4.  **Versioning & Logs:** I will diligently update the version number and changelog at the top of every file I modify.
5.  **Holistic Analysis:** I will always review the entire project source to understand the full context before making changes.
6.  **Methodical Approach:** I will address one primary goal at a time to ensure focused and accurate results.

#### For the Human (Your Responsibilities)
1.  **Provide Complete Source:** Always provide the full, updated project source using the built-in export tool. This ensures I have the complete context.
2.  **Provide Last Source After Error:** If something goes wrong, please provide the last complete project source file that you were working with. This helps me diagnose the problem accurately.
3.  **Clear, Singular Goal:** For each prompt, please define one primary objective (e.g., "Fix this bug," "Implement this feature," "Refactor this file"). This helps me provide a focused and effective response.
4.  **Verify and Report:** After implementing my changes, please test the application. If there are any issues or if the build fails, provide the error messages or a description of the problem.
